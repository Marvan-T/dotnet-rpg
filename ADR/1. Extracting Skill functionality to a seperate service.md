# Decision to extract Skill functionality to a separate service

Originally the Skills functionality was placed in the `CharacterService`. After going through the pain 
of managing the tests with related to all that logic, i've decided to move the Skills functionality to it's own
service. I have also thought about the following concerns when making this decision (these could be used as pointers for similar
decisions in the future).

- Skill's properties (Id, Name, Damage) can be modified independently from a Character.
- We would want to modify Skills outside of `Character` context (add/modifying skills).
- Functionality of `Skill` can exist independently from `Character`

Although their is a relationship between `Character` and `Skill` the functionality of `Skill` can exist 
independently from `Character`. 


## Other points considered:
- **Complexity**: If your CharacterService is growing in complexity, it might be a good decision to move the Skills functionality to a separate service. This leads to smaller, more maintainable services, which can contribute to easier debugging and development.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Following the Single Responsibility Principle, a service class should have only one reason to change. If your CharacterService class is handling character-related concerns (creation, update, deletion, etc.) as well as skill-related concerns (adding skills, updating skills, etc.), it means your service has more than one responsibility. In this case, refactoring to separate services could be a suitable decision.
- **Future Growth:** If you foresee the Skills functionality growing independently from the Character logic, it would be beneficial to split these responsibilities for easier future expansion.
