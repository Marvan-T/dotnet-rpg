# Use of the specification pattern

## 1. The Concept
The core idea behind the Specification pattern is to encapsulate the logic for selecting objects (in this case, database entities) into separate classes. Instead of having various methods in your repository like GetByThisCondition, GetByThatCondition, etc., you define one method that takes a "specification" and returns data based on that specification.

## 2. ISpecification Interface
This interface provides the foundation for all specifications. It's a contract that every specification needs to adhere to.

**Criteria:** This is the condition (or conditions) you want your objects to meet. It's an expression that filters the dataset. If you want all entities, this can be null.

**Includes:** Used in Entity Framework to specify related data to include in the query results (e.g., .Include(x => x.RelatedEntity)). It's a way to handle eager loading.

**IncludeStrings:** Another way to handle eager loading but using strings instead of strongly-typed expressions. It gives more flexibility at the cost of type-safety.

**OrderBy:** This is your sorting logic. It defines how the data should be ordered when it's retrieved.

```csharp
public interface ISpecification<T>
{
    Expression<Func<T, bool>> Criteria { get; }
    List<Expression<Func<T, object>>> Includes { get; }
    Func<IQueryable<T>, IOrderedQueryable<T>> OrderBy { get; }
    // IncludeStrings is not used in this implemented
}
```

## 3. Concrete Specifications
These are implementations of the ISpecification<T> interface. Each concrete specification encapsulates a particular selection logic.

For example, CharactersSortedByScoreSpecification encapsulates the logic for retrieving characters sorted by victories and then defeats. Instead of having this logic in the repository or service, you isolate it into its own class.

## 4. IRepository & Implementation
The generic repository now has a method ListAsync(ISpecification<T> spec) that takes a specification as a parameter.

Inside this method:

1. Start by forming a basic query.
2. If a Criteria is provided in the specification, it filters the dataset based on that criteria. 
3. If any Includes are specified, they are added to the query to fetch related data. 
4. If an OrderBy is provided, it sorts the data accordingly. 
5. Finally, the query is executed and the data is returned.

## 5. Usage in the Service Layer
The service layer creates an instance of the desired specification and passes it to the repository. The repository then uses that specification to fetch and return the required data.

For example, in the ScoreCalculationService, if you want to retrieve characters sorted by score, you create an instance of CharactersSortedByScoreSpecification and pass it to the repository's ListAsync method.

Benefits & Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Decoupling: Your data selection logic is now decoupled from the repository. The repository doesn't know or care about specific selection criteria.
- Reusability: You can reuse the same specification in multiple places. If you need to change the selection logic, you change it in one place, and everywhere that uses that specification gets updated.
- Composability: You can combine specifications to create more complex queries without changing existing specifications or the repository.

**Cons:**
- Complexity: For simple applications, it can seem like overkill. The value becomes apparent in larger, more complex applications with diverse querying needs.
- Learning Curve: As you've experienced, there's a bit of a learning curve to understanding the pattern.

In summary, the Specification pattern is about encapsulating "what" you want to select in its own class, separate from the "how" of data retrieval, allowing for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.


## Detailed dissection

1. Class Definition & Constructor

```csharp
public class CharactersSortedByScoreSpecification : ISpecification<Character>
{
    public CharactersSortedByScoreSpecification() 
    {
        Includes = new List<Expression<Func<Character, object>>>();
    }
    ...
}
```
- This class is implementing the ISpecification<Character> interface, meaning it provides a specification for querying Character objects.
- Inside the constructor, it initializes the Includes property with an empty list. This means by default, this specification doesn't request any related entities to be eagerly loaded from the database. If you needed to load related entities, you would add the necessary expressions to this list.

2. Criteria Property

```csharp
public Expression<Func<Character, bool>> Criteria => null;
```

- This property returns an expression that represents the criteria or condition the queried characters must meet. In this case, it's null, meaning there are no additional filters, and all characters should be considered. If you wanted to filter the characters (for example, only active characters or only characters of a certain type), you'd provide the necessary lambda expression here.

3. Includes Property

```csharp
public List<Expression<Func<Character, object>>> Includes { get; }
```

- This property is a list of expressions representing related entities that should be eagerly loaded along with the main Character entities. This is useful when you know you'll need related data and want to load it all in one go to optimize database queries. In this specific implementation, the list is empty by default, as initialized in the constructor.

4. IncludeStrings Property (excluded from current implementation as it is not required)

```csharp
public List<string> IncludeStrings => new List<string>();
```

- This property is another way to handle eager loading but using strings instead of lambda expressions. It offers more flexibility at the expense of type safety. In this specific implementation, an empty list is always returned, indicating no related entities should be loaded using string identifiers.

5. OrderBy Property

```csharp
public Func<IQueryable<Character>, IOrderedQueryable<Character>> OrderBy => 
    charactersQuery => charactersQuery.OrderByDescending(c => c.Victories).ThenByDescending(c => c.Defeats);
```

- This is where the main logic of this specification lies. The OrderBy property is a function that takes an IQueryable<Character> and returns an IOrderedQueryable<Character>.
- The provided function specifies that the input query (representing all characters) should be sorted in descending order by the Victories property. If two characters have the same number of victories, they should then be sorted in descending order by the Defeats property. This ensures that the characters with the most victories appear first, and among those, characters with fewer defeats are prioritized.

In essence, this class is a blueprint for a database query. Instead of writing a specific database query in the repository, you're defining the "shape" or "specification" of the query in this class. The repository, armed with this blueprint, can then construct and execute the actual database query. This abstraction allows for greater flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.
