Sure, let's break down these two approaches:

**Approach 1:**

```csharp
_context.Characters.Add(character);
await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

In the first approach, you are using the `Add` method, which is synchronous. This means that the method will complete its execution before the next line of code is run. It does not actually interact with the database; it just marks the entity as added in the change tracker. Then, the `SaveChangesAsync` method is called which is an asynchronous operation that will interact with the database and actually insert the new entity.

**Approach 2:**

```csharp
await _context.Characters.AddAsync(character);
```

In the second approach, `AddAsync` is an asynchronous method that adds the given entity to the context in the `Added` state such that it will be inserted into the database when `SaveChanges` is called. While `AddAsync` is an async method, it's important to note that this method doesn't make any database operations, it just provides an async way to add the entity to the `DbContext`. 

There is not much benefit in using `AddAsync` over `Add` because the `AddAsync` method does not involve any I/O bound work, it just prepares the data to be saved and this is a fast operation. `Async` methods are mainly beneficial when there are I/O operations involved, like when calling `SaveChangesAsync`, which does interact with the database.

<blockquote class="callout">
    So, the key takeaway here is: if you're not dealing with an I/O operation (such as a network or disk operation), there's no real advantage to using the `Async` version of a method. The real advantage of asynchronous operations in .NET is when you're dealing with I/O-bound operations, like database operations, file operations, or network calls, where the method can return immediately, freeing up system resources while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
