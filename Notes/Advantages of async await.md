Here are some of the advantages:

1. **Improving Application Responsiveness**: When you're building a user interface, you don't want a long-running task to freeze your application and make it unresponsive. By running the task asynchronously using async/await, you allow your application to continue handling user input while the task is running.

2. **Improving Scalability of Web Applications**: On the server side, each incoming request typically requires a new thread to be handled when using synchronous processing. Threads are a limited resource, and for a high volume of incoming requests, you can run out of threads and block incoming requests. With asynchronous processing using async/await, you can handle many requests concurrently with a much smaller number of threads, because threads can be freed up when they're just waiting for IO operations (like network requests or database queries) to complete. This makes your application much more scalable.


example for each:

**Improving Application Responsiveness**

Let's assume you have a Windows Forms application with a button that, when clicked, downloads a large file. If you were to handle the button click synchronously, the UI would freeze up while the file was being downloaded, making for a poor user experience.

Here's how you might handle the button click synchronously:

```csharp
private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    DownloadFile("http://example.com/largefile");
    MessageBox.Show("Download complete!");
}

private void DownloadFile(string url)
{
    using (var client = new WebClient())
    {
        client.DownloadFile(url, "largefile");
    }
}
```

If you use async/await to handle the button click asynchronously, the UI will remain responsive while the file is being downloaded:

```csharp
private async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    await DownloadFileAsync("http://example.com/largefile");
    MessageBox.Show("Download complete!");
}

private async Task DownloadFileAsync(string url)
{
    using (var client = new WebClient())
    {
        await client.DownloadFileTaskAsync(url, "largefile");
    }
}
```

In the async version, `button1_Click` returns immediately after `DownloadFileAsync` is called, keeping the UI thread free to handle user input. The `await` keyword ensures that the method resumes after `DownloadFileAsync` has completed, so the "Download complete!" message box is shown at the right time.

**Improving Scalability of Web Applications**

For a web application, consider a scenario where a request to your server involves fetching data from another server. If you handle this request synchronously, you could quickly run out of threads if there are many incoming requests, because each request would need its own thread to wait for the data.

Here's how you might handle the request synchronously in an ASP.NET Core controller:

```csharp
public IActionResult GetData()
{
    var data = _client.DownloadData("http://example.com/data");
    return View(data);
}
```

By handling the request asynchronously with async/await, you allow the server to use the thread for other requests while waiting for the data, improving the scalability of your application:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> GetData()
{
    var data = await _client.DownloadDataAsync("http://example.com/data");
    return View(data);
}
```

In the async version, the `GetData` method immediately returns a `Task<IActionResult>`, and the server can reuse the thread to handle another request. The `await` keyword ensures that the method resumes after `DownloadDataAsync` has completed, so the data is correctly passed to the `View`.
