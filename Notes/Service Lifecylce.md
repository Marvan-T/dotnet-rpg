Whether a service is registered as `Transient`, `Scoped`, or `Singleton` dictates its lifetime and behavior within the dependency injection system, but you can always retrieve any of these service lifetimes within a scope. Let's clarify how each behaves within a scope:

1. **Transient**: Always provides a new instance each time the service is requested, regardless of the scope. So if you request a `Transient` service multiple times within the same scope, you'll get distinct instances each time.

2. **Scoped**: Provides a new instance the first time it's requested within a given scope. Any subsequent requests for the service within the same scope will receive the same instance. If you were to create a new scope and request the service, it would then be a new instance for that new scope.

3. **Singleton**: Provides the same instance regardless of the scope. All requests across all scopes (and outside of scopes) will receive the same instance.
