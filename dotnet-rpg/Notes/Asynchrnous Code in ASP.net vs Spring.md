# Why asynchronous code is prevalent in ASP.net?

- One reason is that ASP.net has a more mature and integrated support for asynchronous programming, especially since the introduction of the async and await keywords in C# and VB.NET. These keywords make writing and reading asynchronous code much easier and more natural, as they allow you to express the intent of your code without having to deal with callbacks, continuations, or Task objects directly. They also handle the synchronization context for you, which means you don't have to worry about marshaling the execution back to the original thread or context. In contrast, Spring relies on the @Async annotation and the Future interface, which are more verbose and less expressive. They also require you to enable async support in the configuration class, and to handle exceptions and timeouts manually.

- Another reason is that ASP.net has a different request processing model than Spring. In ASP.net, each request is handled by a thread from a fixed-size thread pool. If the thread is blocked by a synchronous operation, such as a database query or a web service call, it cannot service another request until the operation is completed. This can lead to poor scalability and performance, especially under high concurrency or high latency scenarios. Therefore, using asynchronous code can help to free up the thread while waiting for the operation to complete, and allow it to handle other requests in the meantime. This can improve the responsiveness and throughput of the application.

- In Spring, however, each request is handled by a servlet container, such as Tomcat or Jetty, which typically uses a non-blocking I/O model. This means that the thread does not block while waiting for an I/O operation, but instead registers a callback that will be invoked when the operation is completed. This allows the thread to handle other requests while the I/O operation is pending. Therefore, using asynchronous code may not have as much benefit as in ASP.net, as the thread is already non-blocking.

## What are servelets? 

- A servlet container is a component of a web server that handles the communication between the client browsers and the servlets. A servlet is a Java program that runs on the server side and can dynamically generate web pages based on the client’s request. A servlet container is responsible for managing the life cycle of servlets, such as loading, initializing, executing, and destroying them. A servlet container also provides services such as security, concurrency, and session management for the servlets.

- Some examples of servlet containers are Apache Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss, and WebLogic. They are also known as web containers or application servers. They implement the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications, which define how servlets and JSPs should interact with the web server and the client.
